# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
   post = Post.create(title:'Chicago', description: 'Copenhagen')
   post1 = Post.create(title:'Bukhara', description: 'all about Bukhara')
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
